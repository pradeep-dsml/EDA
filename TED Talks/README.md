## What is the notebook about?

The pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data science workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. However, the size and complexity of the pandas library makes it challenging to discover the best way to accomplish any given task.

In this notebook, we'll use pandas to answer questions about a real-world dataset. Through each section, we'll learn important data science skills as well as "best practices" for using pandas. we'll do some EDA and visualization by answering the question about dataset.
